# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    conditionals are useful any time you have a block of code that you only want to execute when certain conditions are met. I currently feel that only the simplest of programs could avoid using conditionals.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    I would change my approach to the code challenges. I wanted to push myself and do all 3, but I'm not fast enough to do all the coding in 5 minutes, but I spent probably an hour trying before I decided to only do 2.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    I think the most satisfying moment of this assignment was actually just researching a few things. I looked at the documentation for the difference between print, puts, and p, and I also learned about .even?, .odd? and the modulo operator.
